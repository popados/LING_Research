### Day 01 | 10/7/2023 - Saturday

I am writing out questions and ideas for my poster topic. The working title will be ***Cybercrime: History and Terminology.***

To me this is interesting because its a cross-section of Computer Science, Linguistics, and Criminology/Criminal Justice.

Overall I want to see what is being done in the world of law to deal with cybercrime.

Some of the questions I am asking myself:

- What is hacking? Or a hack?
- What are damages done by cybercrime?
- How is jargon used? Why must the wording be precise?
- Why is cryptography important?
- Perception of hackers? Media? Reality?
- What words scream cybercrime?
- Do ransomeware notes/emails exist? Do we analyze them the same as a regular ransome note?
- How does the industry view cybercrime vs the public?
- Are lack of laws and education the reason why crime is so prevelant online?
- Is it more profitable to do cybercrime?
- Pejorative terms?
- Why do people commit these crimes? Do they happen all the time?
- Is there a name for people who fall for cybercrime attacks?
- Are there "missions" for hacker groups? Malicious vs white hat groups?


This is a list I was thinking thorugh over the weekend. Some stuff I'm wondering is specific to the idea that "cybercrime" is the term we should use to describe damages performed on the internet.

My thought process for this is give evidance for changing terms and bringing some of these terms to the legal world. Not sure where I should go from here. Just going to keep expanding this document with stuff.

#### Todo

- Research methodology
- Survey methods
- Finding a description
- Creating a synopsis of the problem/idea.
