### Day 01 | 10/7/2023 - Saturday

I am writing out questions and ideas for my poster topic. The working title will be ***Cybercrime: History and Terminology.***

To me this is interesting because its a cross-section of Computer Science, Linguistics, and Criminology/Criminal Justice.

Overall I want to see what is being done in the world of law to deal with cybercrime.

Descriptive study.


### Day 02 | 10/17/2023 - Tuesday

Introduction writing day.

Describe and summarize points I want to make.

- Analysis
- Make points and thesis
- Start of abstract
- What am I doing
  - What to learn
  - How I want to present to others
  - Types of Research

Start answering the questions I have. Summarize articles.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Write a what and why introduction. Explain what and how this emerging subset of crime.

#### Questions I am asking myself

- What is hacking? Or a hack?
- How is jargon used? Why must the wording be precise?
- Perception of hackers? Media? Reality? (Sideline but still there)
- What words scream cybercrime?
- Do ransomeware notes/emails exist? Do we analyze them the same as a regular ransome note?
- How does the industry view cybercrime vs the public?
- Is there a name for people who fall for cybercrime attacks?
  - Pejorative terms?
- Are there "missions" for hacker groups? Malicious vs white hat groups?
  - maybe look at hate groups too for discrimitary patterns
- How someone outside of tech can show me new perspectives?
- Why is it ethical, what words.
- Malicious Intent
- AI core values
- 

- Why do people commit these crimes? Do they happen all the time?*
- Is it more profitable to do cybercrime?*
- Why is cryptography important?*
- What are damages done by cybercrime?*
- Are lack of laws and education the reason why crime is so prevelant online? (save for forensic linguistics)*

*shelved

This is a list I was thinking thorugh over the weekend. Some stuff I'm wondering is specific to the idea that "cybercrime" is the term we should use to describe damages performed on the internet.

My thought process for this is give evidence for changing terms and bringing some of these terms to the legal world. Not sure where I should go from here. Just going to keep expanding this document with stuff.

Looking to expand my todo list involving research.

Lit Review. Find out what others have written.

> Title – Cybercrime: History and Terminology

**Focus**
My research will attempt to answer questions concerning crime in the modern era, specifically cyberspace. By finding evidence dealing with cybercrime, we can attempt to shine a light on the types of terminology, history, and legal precedents that this type of crime will have.

**Description** –  
Terminology, history, and legal precedents are the highlights of this proposal. I will answer questions about how, when, and why cyberspace must be looked at for research within linguistics. Some questions will be answered: How does the industry view this versus public opinion? Is it more profitable for the individual to do cybercrime? Are there “missions” for hacker groups? Aside from this, a historical view of the Internet and its activities will be provided.
